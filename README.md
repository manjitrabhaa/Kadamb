# Kadamb
"The Kadamb" in Hindu mythology refers to the divine God Shree Krishna's favorite tree. Just as the Kadamb tree symbolizes love, beauty, and transcendence in Hindu culture, this project endeavors to cultivate a virtual garden of wisdom, where each quote serves as a fragrant blossom, enriching the soul and uplifting the spirit.
